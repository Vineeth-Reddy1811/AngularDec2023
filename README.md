The repository comprises multiple Angular projects, each constructed independently to explore different aspects and functionalities of the Angular framework for learning purposes.

The primary project is RecipeApp ( just rename RecipeApp2 -> RecipeApp), where we develop a recipe book application. This application allows users to create new recipes, including details about the ingredients. Additionally, users can add these ingredients to a built-in shopping list within the app.

It has been hosted in Firebase. URL : https://ng-course-recipe-book-12c48.web.app/
